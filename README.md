My new web development portfolio

## Description

I created a digital portfolio of all my web development projects so that potential employers can easily view my past work. Using HTML and CSS I was able to combine showcase my projects, highlight the most impressive ones, create an about me page, and give contact information.

## Problem

I have a few web development projects buit but no portfolio to showcase them to potential employers.

## Solution

I created a portfolio page using HTML and CSS so that employers have an easy, eye-catching, user friendly way to easily access all my projects.
